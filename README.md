Super Awesome Intelligent Linguistic-computer: Conversational AI. This is a project for a class at the Rochester Institute of Technology designed to converse with humans in a hopefully realistic and often times hilarious way.

It works by attempting to model the human brain with a long-term neural network (compiled) and a short term network formed as you talk to it. It also contains a n-gram analysis step to try and avoid sentences that don't make any sense. Considering it has no pre-programmed output, and it relies on a changing network the same input does not always give the same output.

How to use

You don't. Not yet, at least. Seriously, it's weird. However, if you were so inclined just go to your shell and run it:

`python _main_.py`
